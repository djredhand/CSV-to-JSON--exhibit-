In the course, learners are asked to understand and employ the evidence-based framework to research and develop an intervention strategy that addresses disparities in birth outcomes in a local community. Learners makes a series of choices about finding data to accurately describe the problem, evaluate interventions based on evidence and applicability to the community, and defend their choices. The course outcome -- securing funding for interventions chosen -- depends on sound evidence-based decision-making. As learners work through their assigned tasks in the course, feedback alerts them to how well they have understood the material presented.",

And yet there are some basic principles one can apply in both preventing conflict and in contributing positively to its resolution once conflict arises. This session will provide a very innovative look at conflict, why it arises, and what can be done to resolve it. Also discussed will be collaboration, how it represents ONE approach to conflict resolution, and why it is an essential competency in public health practice",

   "Description": "New data indicates that 26 million American adults have Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and millions of others are at increased risk. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, and significant increases in diabetes are expected to lead to corresponding increases in CKD and renal failure.Studies show that early identification and intervention is effective in slowing the progression of co-morbid diseases and complications of CKD in diabetes. Early detection can also help prevent the progression of kidney disease to kidney failure. African Americans, Hispanics, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans and seniors are at increased risk for the disease. This presentation will demonstrate how outcomes can be improved through increased awareness and education on the timely evaluation and management of CKD for health care providers who care for people with diabetes; who is at risk for the disease; methods for early identification of CKD; and management of CKD in people with diabetes.",

Mr. Norwood will present a model of community health care planning and policy innovation that has informed and catalyzed a community-wide effort to align strategies and interventions to de-mystify and institutionalize efforts to eliminate health disparities.

These new recommendations are critical to identifying people who are living with the disease. Testing is the first step to identify infected persons so that they can receive lifesaving care and treatment, which can break the cycle of transmission, slow disease progression, and prevent deaths from liver cancer. The new recommendations are intended to serve as a resource for public health officials, organizations, and health care professionals providing prevention and care services for persons at risk for chronic hepatitis B.

Women employed in agricultural work and other low wage jobs, like hotel housekeepers, restaurant employees, and factory workers, face sexual violence in the workplace at alarming rates. For these women, sexual harassment ranges from inappropriate touching and comments to rape. These women are often unfamiliar with their rights and are usually non-English speakers, so many never admit to being harassed. Medical providers play a key role in identifying and treating low wage women who suffer from workplace sexual violence. However, sometimes protocols are not in place to help identify a woman who is suffering from this violence.

A sexual history is important for all patients because it provides information that identifies high-risk behaviors that can lead to an unintended pregnancy and/or a sexually transmitted infection, including HIV. Taking a thorough sexual history can also be a gateway for and direct essential risk reduction counseling.Many clinicians and outreach workers in the health care field are concerned about their ability to take an appropriate and thorough sexual history. Also many patients, and sometimes the clinicians, are embarrassed or feel uncomfortable talking about sexual issues. It is important for the provider to be competent and professionally skilled in talking with the patient(s) in a non-threatening manner, to find out what problems exist, and uncover the appropriate background information and clinical history.

Learners make a series of choices about finding data to accurately describe the problem, evaluate interventions based on evidence and applicability to the community, and defend their choices. The course outcome ` securing funding for interventions chosen ` depends on sound evidence-based decision-making. As learners work through their assigned tasks in the course, feedback alerts them to how well they have understood the material presented.

Studies suggest that the use of PC as an integral part of patient care has a beneficial impact on both a patien_\u0019s quality of life and attendant health care costs.After watching this broadcast participants will be able to:  * Comprehend the history and evolution of the concept of PC  * Value the use of PC as an integral part of all areas of medical practice, not just end-of-life care  * Understand the importance of PC on patient/family quality of life issues as well as control and management of a chronic disease  * Recognize the impact of PC on hea",

It is a philosophy that can be applied to policy, systems and environmental changes, so that processes function better for a wider range of people. It developed in response to insights about the potential of design as an asset and facilitator to in response to changing demographics and the diversity of human populations, their abilities and their needs. UD is also called inclusive design, human centered design and design-for-all.The principles of UD have a significant role in advancing Public Health efforts to improve health outcomes and reduce disparities among populations.

Such health interventions include conducting community outreach programs, providing culturally competent care, and providing education to immigrant and migrant populations. Such efforts connect families to health care and promote healthy living. Ultimately, health interventions for immigrant and migrant groups strive to alleviate health issues that are disproportionately high in such populations relative to the general population.

In New Jersey, Black infants experience premature death at two to three times the rates of White infants. Stress is a major modifiable risk factor for adverse birth outcomes among women of color. Stress has been linked to preterm delivery, and researchers are examining the impact of racism on this psychosocial response including anxiety, depression, and anger. The Black Infant Mortality Reduction Resource Center (BIMRRC) within the Northern NJ Maternal/Child Health Consortium was established in 1999 to increase awareness of racial/ethnic perinatal health disparities. This presentation will discuss current statistics related to pregnancy outcomes, discuss the role of stress and racism in reducing disparities, and highlight new evidence-based interventions that have improved pregnancy outcomes for Black women.
