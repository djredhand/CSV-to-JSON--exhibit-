Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, and significant increases in diabetes are expected to lead to corresponding increases in CKD and renal failure.Studies show that early identification and intervention is effective in slowing the progression of co-morbid diseases and complications of CKD in diabetes. Early detection can also help prevent the progression of kidney disease to kidney failure. African Americans, Hispanics, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans and seniors are at increased risk for the disease.

In this course we explore how markets function by examining the demand behavior of consumers and the supply behavior of firms. We explore how market-based factors and governmental policies impact market outcomes. The concepts of private and social welfare are introduced as a framework for assessing the performance of markets. The course concludes with an application of economic tools to the policy issue of cigarette smoking. The course consists of eight separate modules, each of which is approximately 10 minutes in length. The material is quite general in nature, and is intended to improve the ability of preparedness professionals to project how markets will respond to significant public health events.",

      "Description": "In the United States, racial and ethnic disparities in infant mortality persist despite greater medical and technological advances and steady declines in prevalence. In New Jersey, Black infants experience premature death at two to three times the rates of White infants. Stress is a major modifiable risk factor for adverse birth outcomes among women of color. Stress has been linked to preterm delivery, and researchers are examining the impact of racism on this psychosocial response including anxiety, depression, and anger. The Black Infant Mortality Reduction Resource Center (BIMRRC) within the Northern NJ Maternal/Child Health Consortium was established in 1999 to increase awareness of racial/ethnic perinatal health disparities. This presentation will discuss current statistics related to pregnancy outcomes, discuss the role of stress and racism in reducing disparities, and highlight new evidence-based interventions that have improved pregnancy outcomes for Black women.",

Participants will be given thorough survey data and the steps taken culminating in program development, expansion and entrenchment in the community. They will also be given information regarding the barriers faced in development and issues of implementation. They will also be presented with advantages of coalition-based programming housed within a public health department with cooperative implementation by a police department.",

This virus is spreading from person-to-person worldwide, probably in much the same way that regular seasonal influenza viruses spread. On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) signaled that a pandemic of 2009 H1N1 flu was underway. This workshop will present some of the history and understanding the science community brings us about the viral evolution of the novel influenze A (H1N1), along with the changing epidemiology of the pandemic. The presenter will lay out the implications associated with the idea of a pandemic situation, will discuss mode of transmission among humans, what the signs and symptoms of this virus are, and will review the prevention and treatment options as well as the recommended public health policies and practices with respect to the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus.",

      "Description": "The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) defines workplace violence as violent acts (including physical assaults and threats of assaults) directed toward persons at work or on duty. This includes terrorism as illustrated by the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001 that resulted in the deaths of 2,886 workers in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania. Incidents of work related violence were virtually unheard of until the 1970s. Since then, it has more than tripled. There are many contributing factors and social issues, especially substance abuse, illegal drugs, access to guns, the portrayal of violence in the news media, online games, TV and movies layoffs, and poverty are major contributors to occupational violence. The goal of the program is to provide an overview to address potential or actual workplace violence.",

This presentation will inform participants about the background and significance of CRC screening in the African-American community, CRC treatment options, barriers and facilitators to CRC screening in this community and suggested strategies to improve screening rates. Participants will learn about CRC screening in the African-American community in the attempt to help minimize adverse health outcomes in this population and address the wider societal problem of health disparities in the US. Additionally, participants will have the opportunity to reflect on how health interventions can be more responsive to the cultural, ethnic, and social characteristics of affected populations.",

Tuberculosis continues to be a major public health threat globally; in 2006 there were 9.2 million new cases of tuberculosis and 1.7 million deaths from TB worldwide. The seminar will also discuss current challenges to TB control including drug resistance, the TB/HIV co-epidemic and lack of resources for diagnosis and treatment in international settings. Tuberculosis is still a challenge in the United States as well, particularly in specific populations. Since TB is airborne and a person with infectious TB can be a threat to public health, a system of public health regulations exists around diagnosis, reporting, and treatment. The seminar will also provide an overview of the public health practices and infrastructure involved in TB control nationally, and specifically in New Jersey.",

In the course, learners are asked to understand and employ the evidence-based framework to research and develop an intervention strategy that addresses disparities in birth outcomes in a local community. Learners makes a series of choices about finding data to accurately describe the problem, evaluate interventions based on evidence and applicability to the community, and defend their choices. The course outcome -- securing funding for interventions chosen -- depends on sound evidence-based decision-making. As learners work through their assigned tasks in the course, feedback alerts them to how well they have understood the material presented.",

      "Description": "From Evidence to Practice is a self-paced, web-based course, that teaches the evidence-based public health decision-making process by plunging learners into a realistic situation. In the course, learners are asked to understand and employ the evidence-based framework to research and develop an intervention strategy that addresses disparities in birth outcomes in a local community. Learners make a series of choices about finding data to accurately describe the problem, evaluate interventions based on evidence and applicability to the community, and defend their choices. The course outcome securing funding for interventions chosen depends on sound evidence-based decision-making. As learners work through their assigned tasks in the course, feedback alerts them to how well they have understood the material presented. Upon finishing the course, they may print out a certificate of completion. From Evidence to Practice is unique in its approach to web-based content delivery. Please let us know what you think",

This presentation will address situations where the participants don't have good leadership and are receive conflicting orders from a variety of supervisors. Participants will learn that in the absence of models like ICS, this scenario creates poor accountability, allows for freelancing, stops the flow of information, lacks coordination of operational efforts, creates poor operational safety, and doesn't move the community experiencing the emergency to a more normal state of being. Finally, this seminar will help to create procedures to reduce the impact of a crisis, focus on developing partnerships, while maintaining multiple allegiances.",

      "Description": "This session will include a discussion of conflict, conflict resolution, and collaboration, and how they are all tightly related. Conflict is all around us, in all aspects of our lives. It seems to be inherent in our culture and perhaps in just being human. While it's easy to create conflict, resolving it often defies our abilities. And yet there are some basic principles one can apply in both preventing conflict and in contributing positively to its resolution once conflict arises. This session will provide a very innovative look at conflict, why it arises, and what can be done to resolve it. Also discussed will be collaboration, how it represents ONE approach to conflict resolution, and why it is an essential competency in public health practice",

Public health leaders are already involved in a wide array of health promotion, prevention and disease management programs from AIDS to zoonoses, anti-smoking and immunization campaigns, safe food and water inspections, plus bioterrorism preparedness. But now, as we learn more about the social determinants of health: education, income, housing and transportation - we need to examine an even broader framework for public health action in our communities, large and small. In this program we'll discuss these new challenges for public health professionals.",

The background material presented allows public health workers to: (1)appreciate the history and evolution of not-for-profits; (2) understand the process of organizing as a not-for-profit; and (3)determine the financial implications of not-for-profit organization. This understanding is particularly important since the not-for-profit sector accounts for approximately 80% of the hospitals in the U.S. and plays a key role in many other aspects of community health and health care delivery.",

Examples and interactive exercises offer opportunities to increase your skills in presenting data to co-workers, community-based organizations, hospitals, public agencies, boards of health, and general public. Topics include: uses of rates and counts, prevalence, incidence, mortality, crude versus category-specific rates, confidence intervals, p-values, graphs and tables, and sources of public health data. Idaho-specific and U.S. national data examples are used. The intended audience includes public health nurses, sanitarians, other frontline public health workers, and health educators who have not had epidemiological or statistical training but need to be able to read, interpret, and present public health data.",
