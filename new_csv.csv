Learning objectives:    * Identify two cultural barriers that make access to health care difficult.    * Name two interventions that may overcome the marginal economic status of some immigrants/miImmigrants and migrant workers to the United States face a variety of barriers that may make access to health care difficult.  These barriers can be linked to their economic, social, and cultural status. Health interventions for such populations circumvent barriers by being mindful of cultural and economic issues that may preclude families from receiving timely, quality health care. Such health interventions include conducting community outreach programs, providing culturally competent care, and providing education to immigrant and migrant populations. Such efforts connect families to health care and promote healthy living. Ultimately, health interventions for immigrant and migrant groups strive to alleviate health issues that are disproportionately high in such populations relative to the general population.

In New Jersey, Black infants experience premature death at two to three times the rates of White infants. Stress is a major modifiable risk factor for adverse birth outcomes among women of color. Stress has been linked to preterm delivery, and researchers are examining the impact of racism on this psychosocial response including anxiety, depression, and anger. The Black Infant Mortality Reduction Resource Center (BIMRRC) within the Northern NJ Maternal/Child Health Consortium was established in 1999 to increase awareness of racial/ethnic perinatal health disparities. This presentation will discuss current statistics related to pregnancy outcomes, discuss the role of stress and racism in reducing disparities, and highlight new evidence-based interventions that have improved pregnancy outcomes for Black women.",1 hour,Webstream,24,,,Analytical/Assessment Skills,1,,355,Social Equity in Birth Outcomes: Black Infant Mortality Reduction in NJ,0,Maternal / Child Health,23

In the course, learners are asked to understand and employ the evidence-based framework to research and develop an intervention strategy that addresses disparities in birth outcomes in a local community. Learners make a series of choices about finding data to accurately describe the problem, evaluate interventions based on evidence and applicability to the community, and defend their choices. The course outcome securing funding for interventions chosen depends on sound evidence-based decision-making. As learners work through their assigned tasks in the course, feedback alerts them to how well they have understood the material presented. Upon finishing the course, they may print out a certificate of completion. From Evidence to Practice is unique in its approach to web-based content delivery.
