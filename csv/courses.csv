Chronic Kidney Disease in Diabetes: Identification and Intervention,1,"New data indicates that 26 million American adults have Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and millions of others are at increased risk. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, and significant increases in diabetes are expected to lead to corresponding increases in CKD and renal failure.

Studies show that early identification and intervention is effective in slowing the progression of co-morbid diseases and complications of CKD in diabetes. Early detection can also help prevent the progression of kidney disease to kidney failure. African Americans, Hispanics, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans and seniors are at increased risk for the disease. This presentation will demonstrate how outcomes can be improved through increased awareness and education on the timely evaluation and management of CKD for health care providers who care for people with diabetes; who is at risk for the disease; methods for early identification of CKD; and management of CKD in people with diabetes.New data indicates that 26 million American adults have Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and millions of others are at increased risk.

These barriers can be linked to their economic, social, and cultural status. Health interventions for such populations circumvent barriers by being mindful of cultural and economic issues that may preclude families from receiving timely, quality health care. Such health interventions include conducting community outreach programs, providing culturally competent care, and providing education to immigrant and migrant populations. Such efforts connect families to health care and promote healthy living. Ultimately, health interventions for immigrant and migrant groups strive to alleviate health issues that are disproportionately high in such populations relative to the general population.  Learning objectives:

Social Equity in Birth Outcomes: Black Infant Mortality Reduction in NJ,1,"In the United States, racial and ethnic disparities in infant mortality persist despite greater medical and technological advances and steady declines in prevalence. In New Jersey, Black infants experience premature death at two to three times the rates of White infants. Stress is a major modifiable risk factor for adverse birth outcomes among women of color. Stress has been linked to preterm delivery, and researchers are examining the impact of racism on this psychosocial response including anxiety, depression, and anger. The Black Infant Mortality Reduction Resource Center (BIMRRC) within the Northern NJ Maternal/Child Health Consortium was established in 1999 to increase awareness of racial/ethnic perinatal health disparities. This presentation will discuss current statistics related to pregnancy outcomes, discuss the role of stress and racism in reducing disparities, and highlight new evidence-based interventions that have improved pregnancy outcomes for Black women.",http://ophp.umdnj.edu/OPHPpodcasts/PublicHealthcast/Entries/2009/9/10_PHSS_-Black_Infant_Mortality_Reduction_in_New_Jersey.html,1A2,A,1A3,A,4A1,A,4A2,A,5A7,A,1B2,,1B3,,4B1,,4B2,,5B7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,355,Webstream,free,1 hour,,22,24,23,0

2009 Pandemic Influenza: H1N1 Current Status and Updates,1,"2009 H1N1 (referred to as ""swine flu"" early on) is a new influenza virus causing illness in people. This new virus was first detected in people in the United States in April 2009. This virus is spreading from person-to-person worldwide, probably in much the same way that regular seasonal influenza viruses spread. On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) signaled that a pandemic of 2009 H1N1 flu was underway. This workshop will present some of the history and understanding the science community brings us about the viral evolution of the novel influenze A (H1N1), along with the changing epidemiology of the pandemic. The presenter will lay out the implications associated with the idea of a pandemic situation, will discuss mode of transmission among humans, what the signs and symptoms of this virus are, and will review the prevention and treatment options as well as the recommended public health policies and practices with respect to the novel influenza A (H1N1) virus.",http://ophp.umdnj.edu/OPHPpodcasts/PublicHealthcast/Entries/2009/11/10_PHSS_-_H1N1_-_Swine_Flu_-_Information_and_Update.html,1A2,A,1A3,A,1A5,A,1A9,A,1A10,A,2A1,A,1B2,,1B3,,1B5,,1B9,,1B10,,2B1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,359,Webstream,free,1.5 hours,,14,8,32,0
Preventing Workplace Violence,1,"The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) defines workplace violence as ""violent acts (including physical assaults and threats of assaults) directed toward persons at work or on duty."" This includes terrorism as illustrated by the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001 that resulted in the deaths of 2,886 workers in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania. Incidents of work related violence were virtually unheard of until the 1970s. Since then, it has more than tripled. There are many contributing factors and social issues, especially substance abuse, illegal drugs, access to guns, the portrayal of violence in the news media, online games, TV and movies layoffs, and poverty are major contributors to occupational violence.

From Evidence to Practice: Using a Systematic Approach to Address Disparities in Birth Outcomes,1,"""From Evidence to Practice"" is a self-paced, web-based course, that teaches the evidence-based public health decision-making process by plunging learners into a realistic situation. In the course, learners are asked to understand and employ the evidence-based framework to research and develop an intervention strategy that addresses disparities in birth outcomes in a local community. Learners make a series of choices about finding data to accurately describe the problem, evaluate interventions based on evidence and applicability to the community, and defend their choices. The course outcome — securing funding for interventions chosen — depends on sound evidence-based decision-making. As learners work through their assigned tasks in the course, feedback alerts them to how well they have understood the material presented. Upon finishing the course, they may print out a certificate of completion. ""From Evidence to Practice"" is unique in its approach to web-based content delivery.

Web and Public Health - Internet Applications for Public Health Education : Part 2,1,"The use of the internet to provide public health information is evolving very quickly. Public Health agencies have traditionally used the internet to disseminate information and create opportunities for individuals to contact agencies directly via the Web.

An evolution in how the Web can be used, or Web 2.0, allows the public to communicate directly with each other through social-media networks such as Facebook and MySpace and other social networking sites. What are the implications for public health education practice? The purpose of this presentation is to provide a continued overview of the differences between Web 1.0 and Web 2.0's conceptualization and applications. Participants will learn to characterize current demographics of social marketing site users and take a look at future trends in its use.
